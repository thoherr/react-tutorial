Reakt tutorial steps
====================

This is my repo working through http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html 

Each commit includes all the changes for a chapter of the tutorial.

For an initial comments file, copy `comments.initial.json` to `comments.json`.

The ruby based server `server.rb` in the root directory of the project
was copied from the original tutorial repository https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial
